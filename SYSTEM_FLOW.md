# System Flow

Based on the current state of the codebase, there is no differentiation between user roles such as student, lecturer, or admin. The application flow is the same for all authenticated users.

## Unauthenticated User Flow

An unauthenticated user can only see the following:

*   **Home Page:** The landing page of the application.
*   **Login/Sign Up Page:** The page where users can log in or create a new account.

## Authenticated User Flow

An authenticated user has access to the following pages and functionalities:

*   **Home Page:** The landing page of the application.
*   **Courses:** View a list of courses.
*   **Create:** Create a new course.
*   **Assessments:** View and manage assessments.
*   **Analytics:** View analytics and reports.
*   **Messaging:** Access the messaging system.
*   **Logout:** Users can log out of their accounts.

This unified flow means that any logged-in user can currently perform all actions available in the application. There are no role-specific restrictions or features implemented.
